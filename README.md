# Horiseon Challenge

## First challenge assignment for Rutgers Coding Bootcamp

In this challenge, I was tasked with refactoring the HTML and CSS code for Horiseon, a marketing agency that wanted an SEO-friendly website that met accessibility standards.

This task was accomplished with a few changes to the HTML file.

- HTML elements were refactored to be more semantic
- HTML elements were refactored to follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- Alt attributes were added to image elements
- Heading attributes were arranged in sequential order
- Added a concise and descriptive title

### Additional changes and enhancements to the HTML and CSS include:

- Properly functioning links
- CSS selectors consolidated and organized
- Proper commenting on HTML and CSS files
- Added CSS enhancements to footer (gradient) and color/pop to 'seo' in Header text
