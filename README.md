# Horiseon Challenge

## First challenge assignment for Rutgers Coding Bootcamp

In this challenge, I was tasked with refactoring the HTML and CSS code for Horiseon, a marekting agency that wanted an SEO-friendly website that followed accessibility.

This task was accomplished with a few changes to the HTML file.
*HTML elements were refactored to be more semantic
*HTML elements were refactored to follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
*Alt attributes were added to image elements
*Heading attributes were arranged in sequential order
\*Added a concise and descriptive title

##Additional changes and enhancements to the HTML and CSS include:
*Properly functioning links
*CSS selectors consolidated and organized
*Proper commenting on HTML and CSS files
*Added CSS enhancements to footer (gradient) and color/pop to 'seo' in Header text
